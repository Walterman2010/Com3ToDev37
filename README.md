# Com3ToDev37
a tool to Connect the Com-Port and the Device ID at USB Ports in Windows systems. It is developed at Windows 10 system.

This tool is developed in Windwos 10 and not testet at Windows 11 jet. Also it is not known, there is still these Issue.

USB Camera Devices and also Webcams are using the Windows Device ID for Video or Audio functions. These are also important if you want to use the Camera in OpenCV. Some of these USB Camera are also controlled by a Serial Com Port.
An Example is the Flir Boson infrared camera.
In normal applications, with only one Camera, the will be now problem to connect the right Com Port to the right Device ID, but if you want to use more then one Device at one computer you can get in truble.

The to Com3ToDev37 (because these Problem was a bloody hell) is a tool what you can Implement in your Program. You need to Feed it with the Com Port and get the Device ID back.

I Always wanted to continue the develop and write a Libary, but I dosn´t have a camera like these, So the Project is stuct. May be it is still usefull. In Case, please let me know ;)
Don´t use in comercial!
